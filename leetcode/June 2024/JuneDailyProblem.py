    # Day 1: Score of a String - Q3110(Easy)
    '''
        You are given a string s. 
        The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.
        Return the score of s.

        Example 1:
        Input: s = "hello"
        Output: 13
        Explanation:
        The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'h' = 104, 'e' = 101, 'l' = 108, 'o' = 111.
        So, the score of s would be |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13.

        Example 2:
        Input: s = "zaz"
        Output: 50
        Explanation:
        The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'z' = 122, 'a' = 97.
        So, the score of s would be |122 - 97| + |97 - 122| = 25 + 25 = 50.


        Constraints:
        2 <= s.length <= 100
        s consists only of lowercase English letters.
    '''
    def scoreOfString(self, s: str) -> int:
        score = 0
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            score += abs(ord(s[i]) - ord(s[i-1]))
        return score

    # Day 2: Reverse String - Q344(Easy)
    '''
        Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

        Example 1:
        Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
        Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

        Example 2:
        Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
        Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

        Constraints:
        1 <= s.length <= 10^5
        s[i] is a printable ascii character.
    '''
    def reverseString(self, s: list):
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
        while l < r:
            s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1
    
    # Day 3: Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence - Q2468(Medium)
    '''
        You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.

        Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.
        A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

        Example 1:
        Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
        Output: 4
        Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
        Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
        It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
        
        Example 2:
        Input: s = "abcde", t = "a"
        Output: 0
        Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s ("abcde").
        
        Example 3:
        Input: s = "z", t = "abcde"
        Output: 5
        Explanation: Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
        Now, t is a subsequence of s ("zabcde").
        It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
        

        Constraints:
        1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5
        s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
