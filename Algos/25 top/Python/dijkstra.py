'''
Dijkstra's Algorithm
    -> Finds shortest path btw source and all nodes.
    -> Weights are used to verify the shortest path.
    -> Creates a route with all nodes with possible shortest path.

    -> Limitations:
        => Works with only positive weights.
        => 

    -> Uses:
        => GPS Devices
        => Network Routing Protocols
        => Airline Traffic Control
